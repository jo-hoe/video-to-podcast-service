# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature modernizes the build system by transforming a complex, OS-dependent Makefile with extensive bash script dependencies into a streamlined, cross-platform build system that leverages Helm tests for validation. The current system has over 1770 lines of Makefile code with 12 supporting bash scripts, creating maintenance overhead and platform compatibility issues. The modernized system will provide essential functionality through a minimal, OS-independent interface while replacing bash-based testing with proper Helm test infrastructure.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: OS-Independent Makefile

**User Story:** As a developer working on different operating systems, I want a Makefile that works consistently across Linux, macOS, and Windows, so that I don't encounter platform-specific build failures.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a developer runs make commands THEN the system SHALL execute without requiring OS-specific tools like bash, netstat, or lsof
2. WHEN the Makefile is executed on different platforms THEN it SHALL produce identical results regardless of the underlying operating system
3. WHEN platform-specific functionality is needed THEN the system SHALL use cross-platform alternatives or gracefully handle missing tools
4. WHEN commands are executed THEN they SHALL NOT use bash-specific syntax, shell scripting, or OS-specific command flags

### Requirement 2: Drastically Reduced Makefile Complexity

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining the build system, I want a minimal Makefile with only essential targets, so that the build system is easier to understand and maintain.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the modernized Makefile is created THEN it SHALL contain fewer than 200 lines of code
2. WHEN reviewing the Makefile targets THEN there SHALL be no more than 15 primary targets
3. WHEN a target is included THEN it SHALL provide essential functionality that cannot be replaced by Helm tests
4. WHEN complex logic is needed THEN it SHALL be moved to appropriate tooling rather than embedded in the Makefile

### Requirement 3: Helm Test Replacement for Bash Scripts

**User Story:** As a developer running tests, I want validation performed through Helm tests instead of bash scripts, so that testing is integrated with Kubernetes deployment lifecycle and works consistently across environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN validation is needed THEN the system SHALL use Helm test pods instead of bash scripts
2. WHEN health checks are performed THEN they SHALL be implemented as Kubernetes Jobs within Helm tests
3. WHEN configuration validation is required THEN it SHALL be performed through Helm test hooks
4. WHEN template validation is needed THEN it SHALL use helm template command with proper error handling
5. WHEN resource validation is performed THEN it SHALL use kubectl-based Helm tests rather than external scripts

### Requirement 4: Essential Build Functionality Preservation

**User Story:** As a developer using the build system, I want core functionality like building, testing, and deployment to remain available, so that my development workflow is not disrupted.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN building the application THEN the system SHALL provide targets for building API and UI components
2. WHEN running tests THEN the system SHALL execute Go tests and linting
3. WHEN working with Docker THEN the system SHALL provide image building and container management
4. WHEN deploying to k3d THEN the system SHALL provide cluster management and deployment targets
5. WHEN cleaning up resources THEN the system SHALL provide cleanup targets for development artifacts

### Requirement 5: Helm Test Infrastructure

**User Story:** As a developer validating deployments, I want comprehensive Helm tests that verify application health and configuration, so that I can trust the deployment is working correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Helm tests are executed THEN they SHALL validate API service health endpoints
2. WHEN Helm tests are executed THEN they SHALL validate UI service health endpoints  
3. WHEN Helm tests are executed THEN they SHALL verify inter-service communication
4. WHEN Helm tests are executed THEN they SHALL validate configuration loading and environment variables
5. WHEN Helm tests run THEN they SHALL provide clear success/failure status and detailed error messages

### Requirement 6: Backward Compatibility for Essential Workflows

**User Story:** As a developer familiar with the current build system, I want essential make targets to continue working with the same interface, so that my muscle memory and scripts don't break.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running `make build` THEN the system SHALL build both API and UI binaries
2. WHEN running `make test` THEN the system SHALL execute the full test suite
3. WHEN running `make start` THEN the system SHALL start the application using docker compose
4. WHEN running `make start-k3d` THEN the system SHALL create a k3d cluster and deploy the application
5. WHEN running `make stop-k3d` THEN the system SHALL clean up the k3d cluster and resources

### Requirement 7: Simplified Error Handling

**User Story:** As a developer encountering build failures, I want clear error messages without complex bash error handling, so that I can quickly identify and resolve issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a make target fails THEN the system SHALL provide a clear error message indicating what went wrong
2. WHEN prerequisite tools are missing THEN the system SHALL inform the user what needs to be installed
3. WHEN cleanup is needed after failure THEN the system SHALL provide simple cleanup commands
4. WHEN errors occur THEN they SHALL NOT be obscured by complex bash error handling scripts

### Requirement 8: Documentation and Migration Guide

**User Story:** As a developer transitioning to the modernized build system, I want clear documentation about what changed and how to use the new system, so that I can adapt my workflow efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the modernization is complete THEN there SHALL be documentation listing all removed targets and their replacements
2. WHEN developers need to understand the new system THEN there SHALL be clear usage examples for each remaining target
3. WHEN Helm tests are implemented THEN there SHALL be documentation explaining how to run and interpret them
4. WHEN migration is needed THEN there SHALL be a guide explaining the differences from the old system
