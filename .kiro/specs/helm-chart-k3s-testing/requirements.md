# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements automated testing for Helm charts using k3s (lightweight Kubernetes) to ensure the video-to-podcast service deploys correctly and functions as expected in a Kubernetes environment. The testing strategy will follow a similar approach to the go-mail-service repository, providing comprehensive validation of chart templates, deployment health, and service functionality.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to automatically test Helm chart deployments in a k3s cluster, so that I can validate my charts work correctly before deploying to production environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a developer runs the test suite THEN the system SHALL create a k3s cluster automatically
2. WHEN the k3s cluster is ready THEN the system SHALL install the Helm chart using test values
3. WHEN the chart is deployed THEN the system SHALL verify all pods are running and healthy
4. WHEN all pods are healthy THEN the system SHALL validate service endpoints are accessible
5. WHEN tests complete THEN the system SHALL clean up the k3s cluster resources

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to test different Helm chart configurations, so that I can ensure various deployment scenarios work correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running chart tests THEN the system SHALL test with default values configuration
2. WHEN running chart tests THEN the system SHALL test with development values configuration
3. WHEN running chart tests THEN the system SHALL test with production values configuration
4. WHEN testing different configurations THEN the system SHALL validate each configuration deploys successfully
5. WHEN configuration tests fail THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages indicating which configuration failed

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to validate service health and connectivity, so that I can ensure the deployed services function correctly in Kubernetes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the API service is deployed THEN the system SHALL verify the health endpoint responds with 200 status
2. WHEN the UI service is deployed THEN the system SHALL verify the health endpoint responds with 200 status
3. WHEN both services are deployed THEN the system SHALL verify inter-service communication works
4. WHEN services are accessible THEN the system SHALL validate service discovery and DNS resolution
5. WHEN persistence is enabled THEN the system SHALL verify persistent volumes are mounted correctly

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to integrate chart testing into CI/CD pipelines, so that chart validation happens automatically on code changes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code is pushed to the repository THEN the system SHALL trigger automated chart tests
2. WHEN chart tests run in CI THEN the system SHALL use containerized k3s for isolation
3. WHEN tests pass THEN the system SHALL allow the pipeline to continue
4. WHEN tests fail THEN the system SHALL block the pipeline and report failures
5. WHEN running in CI THEN the system SHALL generate test reports and artifacts

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to test chart upgrades and rollbacks, so that I can ensure deployment lifecycle operations work correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN testing upgrades THEN the system SHALL deploy an initial chart version
2. WHEN the initial version is deployed THEN the system SHALL upgrade to a new chart version
3. WHEN upgrade completes THEN the system SHALL verify services remain healthy during upgrade
4. WHEN upgrade testing is complete THEN the system SHALL test rollback functionality
5. WHEN rollback completes THEN the system SHALL verify services return to previous working state

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to validate Helm chart templates and values, so that I can catch template errors before deployment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running template tests THEN the system SHALL validate all template files render correctly
2. WHEN validating templates THEN the system SHALL check for required Kubernetes resource fields
3. WHEN testing with different values THEN the system SHALL ensure no template rendering errors occur
4. WHEN template validation fails THEN the system SHALL provide specific error messages with line numbers
5. WHEN templates are valid THEN the system SHALL proceed with deployment testing

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to test resource limits and scaling, so that I can ensure the application behaves correctly under different resource constraints.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN testing resource limits THEN the system SHALL deploy with configured CPU and memory limits
2. WHEN resource limits are applied THEN the system SHALL verify pods start within resource constraints
3. WHEN autoscaling is enabled THEN the system SHALL test horizontal pod autoscaler functionality
4. WHEN testing scaling THEN the system SHALL verify services remain available during scale operations
5. WHEN resource tests complete THEN the system SHALL validate no resource limit violations occurred
