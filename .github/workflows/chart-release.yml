# Currently we cannot release based on tags until this issue is addressed:
# https://github.com/helm/chart-releaser-action/issues/150
## To release via GitHub tags (when the issue is resolved):
## - bump the appVersion and chartVersion in the Chart.yaml
## - create a new release in GitHub and tag it with the new version number
## The version number should conform to the regex below
# on:
#   push:
#     tags:
#       - 'v[0-9]+.[0-9]+.[0-9]+'

# New charts are released by altering the 'charts' folder
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
    paths:
      - 'charts/**'
