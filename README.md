Video To Podcast Service is a backend service that downloads video files (currently only from YouTube), extracts and converts them into audio files, and organizes them into podcast feeds accessible via RSS. The service exposes a REST API for adding new videos, listing available podcast feeds, retrieving audio files, and deleting podcast items.

**Key Features:**

- Download videos (YouTube supported) and convert to audio (MP3)
- Organize audio files into podcast feeds (one feed per channel)
- Serve podcast feeds as RSS for use in podcast apps
- REST API for adding, listing, retrieving, and deleting podcast items
- Automatic cleanup of empty feed directories
- Dockerized for easy deployment

## How to Use

### Start the Service

You can start the service using `make` (recommended):

```bash
make start
```

Or use Docker directly:

```bash
docker build . -t v2p
docker run --rm -p 8080:8080 v2p
```

Or with Docker Compose (includes optional mail webhook):

```bash
make start-service
# or
make start-services-rebuild
```

### Resources

All downloaded resources are placed in the `resources` directory. Podcasts are organized in subdirectories named after the channel the video belongs to. Each feed has its own directory containing audio files and the RSS XML.

## API Usage

The service exposes a REST API. See [`openapi.yaml`](./openapi.yaml) for the full OpenAPI/Swagger specification.

## Linting

The project uses `golangci-lint` for linting. See <https://golangci-lint.run/usage/install/> for installation instructions.

To run linting locally:

```bash
golangci-lint run ./...
```

## Limitations

- Only YouTube is supported as a video source.
- Google may block certain IPs (e.g., from cloud providers), resulting in errors like `403` or age restriction issues. See [this GitHub issue](https://github.com/kkdai/youtube/issues/343#issuecomment-2347950479) for more details.

## Future Work

- Add iTunes to
  - add tags for podcast images (requires custom XML generation)
  - set length in podcast metadata
- Provide ticketing/progress feedback via API
- Auto-chapterize videos without chapters
